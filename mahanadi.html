                    The Mahanadi, meaning "Great River" in Sanskrit, is one of the major rivers of peninsular India and holds immense 
                    historical, cultural, and economic significance. Originating from the highlands of Chhattisgarh near Sihawa in 
                    Dhamtari district, this mighty river flows eastward for 858 kilometers before emptying into the Bay of Bengal.

                    Throughout history, the Mahanadi has been the backbone of agricultural prosperity in the region. The river has 
                    witnessed the rise and fall of numerous dynasties, including the Kalinga Empire, which flourished along its banks. 
                    The famous Kalinga War fought by Emperor Ashoka took place in the delta region of this river, marking a turning 
                    point in Indian history.

                <p><b>
                    The Mahanadi River, one of India’s major rivers, has played a pivotal role in the history, culture, and economy of eastern India. Originating from the Sihawa hills of the Dhamtari district in present-day Chhattisgarh, it flows about 851 kilometres before entering Odisha and finally emptying into the Bay of Bengal. In ancient times, the river was known as the Chitrotpala and is mentioned in several Puranic texts and regional legends, highlighting its sacredness and fertility. Historically, the Mahanadi basin supported some of the earliest settlements in Odisha and Chhattisgarh, becoming a cradle for agriculture, trade, and temple culture. Over centuries, its fertile plains allowed the growth of cities like Sambalpur, Cuttack, and Banki, which thrived on riverine trade routes. Cuttack, the former capital of Odisha, was founded on its banks in the 10th century CE, taking advantage of the natural protection and transportation the river provided.

                    The Mahanadi has also been deeply tied to Odisha’s temple architecture and spiritual life. Numerous shrines — including the famous Dhabaleswar Temple on its islands — arose along its course, blending river worship with Shaivite traditions. During medieval times under the Somavamshi, Eastern Ganga, and later the Maratha rulers, the river was central to irrigation, rice cultivation, and inland navigation, linking coastal trade ports with interior markets. In modern history, British engineers recognised its potential for water management and trade, laying the groundwork for the construction of one of India’s largest multipurpose dams, the Hirakud Dam, completed in 1957. This project transformed the river’s course in terms of flood control, irrigation, and hydroelectricity, marking a major turning point in its management.

                    Today, the Mahanadi remains a lifeline for millions of people in Chhattisgarh and Odisha. It sustains agriculture, industry, and fisheries while retaining its sacred status in local culture, especially during festivals like Kartika Purnima, when thousands of devotees perform rituals along its ghats. The river’s long journey from myth and medieval trade to modern development reflects its enduring importance to the region’s history, making it not just a physical waterway but a living thread connecting Odisha’s past, present, and future.

                    The river has been revered in Hindu mythology and is considered sacred by millions. Ancient temples and ghats 
                    along its course bear testimony to its spiritual significance. The Mahanadi has also played a crucial role in 
                    shaping the cultural identity of Odisha and Chhattisgarh, influencing art, literature, and traditional practices.
