        <div style="max-width:800px; margin:2rem auto; color:#333; font-size:1.1rem;">
            <p>Cuttack, one of the oldest cities in eastern India, was founded in 989 CE by King Nrupa Keshari and served as a strategic military base, with the Barabati Fort at its heart. Over the centuries, it grew into a prominent administrative and cultural center under various dynasties including the Somavamshis, Eastern Gangas, and later the Mughals and Marathas. Its location at the confluence of the Mahanadi and Kathajodi rivers made it a vital center for trade, governance, and defense. The city flourished culturally and architecturally, with temples, mosques, and forts reflecting its diverse history.</p>
            <p>Under British rule, Cuttack became the capital of Odisha and saw major developments in education, law, and infrastructure, including the founding of Ravenshaw College and the establishment of legal institutions. Though the capital shifted to Bhubaneswar in 1948, Cuttack remains the judicial capital of Odisha and an important cultural hub. It is famous for its silver filigree work (Tarakasi), the annual Bali Jatra festival, and as the birthplace of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.</p>
