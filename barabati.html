                    Barabati Fort is a 14th-century fort built by the rulers of the Eastern Ganga dynasty in Cuttack, Odisha. It was originally constructed by Anangabhima Deva III around the early 1200s and later developed under subsequent rulers. The fort stood strategically on the banks of the Mahanadi River and served as a military garrison and royal residence, making it a key political and administrative center of medieval Odisha. It was designed with a massive nine-storied palace (now gone), strong laterite stone walls, a moat for defense, and a large gateway. Over the centuries, Barabati Fort saw many battles and successions — from the Eastern Ganga kings to the Gajapatis, then the Mughals, and later the Marathas and British. By the colonial period, much of the fort had fallen into ruin, but the remnants still showcase Odisha’s rich military and architectural heritage. Today, visitors can see the impressive earthen ramparts, the moat, and the main gateway, along with the nearby modern Barabati Stadium, making it a historic landmark and tourist attraction of Cuttack.
